Claudia Rutt had recently graduated from Stephen F. Austin High, and had enrolled in Texas Christian University for the upcoming fall semester. She aspired to become a professional dancer.

On Aug. 1, she and her fiance, Paul Sonntag, were walking together along the Drag. Sonntag was shot and killed. Rutt ran out from her shelter to him, and was shot.

Rutt was wearing her class ring on her finger, and Sonntagâ€™s ring on a chain around her neck. 

Rutt was buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in Austin, Texas. She was survived by her parents, Melvin Rutt and Diane Labowitz, and her sister, Mary Anne Rutt.
