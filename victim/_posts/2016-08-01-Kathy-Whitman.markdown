In the early morning of August 1, 1966, Charles Whitman killed his wife, Kathleen “Kathy” Whitman before going to the Tower.

The couple met in February 1962 and married that August. At 19, Kathy joined Charles in North Carolina, where he returned to the Marine Corps after losing his scholarship to the University. In July 1963, Kathy returned to UT on her own. The two later reunited when he was discharged in December 1964.

The next fall, Kathy began teaching biology at Sidney Lanier High School. She was a teacher for less than a year before she died.

The day before the mass shooting, Charles bought a knife and binoculars from a 7-Eleven store, and picked up his wife from her summer job as a telephone operator. The next morning, Charles stabbed her repeatedly in the chest as she lay in bed.

Her body was buried in her hometown of Fort Bend County, Texas.
