Margaret Whitman moved to Austin in 1966, hoping to escape the domestic violence of her husband and be closer to her son, Charles. But the night before Whitman’s mass shooting, his mother became his first victim.

Margaret was a Roman Catholic and raised her three sons in the same faith. She had reportedly divorced her abusive husband of 25 years that May, moving from Florida into an apartment at 1212 Guadalupe St. and working at a cafeteria near campus in hopes of starting a new life.

On July 31, 1966, Whitman met his mother for lunch. Just after midnight that night, he drove to her apartment and killed her. Police reports suggest he stabbed her in the chest and shot her in the back of the head, afterwards covering her body with bedsheets. 

Whitman wrote that he was “very upset over having done it” and that “he loved this woman with all [his] heart.”
A joint funeral service and burial was held for the mother and son in their hometown.
