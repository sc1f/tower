Paul Bolton Sonntag was working as a lifeguard in Austin in 1966. He, his fiancee and a close friend, were passing by campus on their way to pick up his paycheck when the shooting began. He was the grandson of Paul Bolton, a news director at KTBC.

Sonntag was struck in the head when he looked out from behind a barrier in front of the Snyder-Chenards dress shop. He was
killed instantly.

Sonntag was survived by his parents Jim and Beverly Sonntag, and his brothers, James and George Sonntag. He is buried at Austin Memorial Park.
