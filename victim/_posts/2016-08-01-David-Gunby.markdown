David Gunby was an electrical engineering student. Gunby was walking from the University library when he remembered to retrieve his book. On his walk back to the library, Gunby was shot in the lower left back. The shooting destroyed his small intestine. 

Although Gunby was among those who survived the shooting, he was left with serious health complications. During surgery it was discovered that Gunby had only one functioning kidney, which had been permanently damaged by bullet fragments. His body rejected the subsequent organ transplant, and he was put on kidney dialysis for the following 27 years. 

In 2001, Gunby decided to be taken off dialysis. His death was ruled as a homicide.
