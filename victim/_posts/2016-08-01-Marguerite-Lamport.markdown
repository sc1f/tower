Marguerite Lamport lived in Austin for 45 years, and often gave friends and relatives tours of the city.

On Aug. 1, she took her brother, M.J. Gabour, his wife and two sons to see the UT Tower. When they opened the door to the 28th floor lobby, Whitman shot them, killing Marguerite and her nephew, Mark. 

M.J. and his eldest son, Mike, warned other visitors to turn around, probably saving lives.
