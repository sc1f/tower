Edna Townsley was Whitmanâ€™s first victim upon arriving to the Tower on Aug. 1. Around the time she would have typically been relieved of her shift, Whitman approached her desk in the observation deck and killed her. 

Townsley began her career at UT as an elevator operator and was later promoted to a secretary.  She worked there for eight years.

Townsley was divorced, but left behind two beloved sons, Danny and Terry. 

She is remembered by friends and colleagues for her sense of humor and unique laugh. She is buried in Lockhart, Texas.
