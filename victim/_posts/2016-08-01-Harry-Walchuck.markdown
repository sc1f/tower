Harry Walchuck earned a masters degree in history from the University of Toledo in 1965. The next year, he moved with his six children and wife, Marilyn, from Sylvania to Michigan, where he taught at Alpena Community College.

Walchuck was pursuing a PhD in political science from UT, when he was killed by Whitman. During lunch, he browsed a shop on the Drag for a magazine, and was shot while speaking to an employee.

Walchuck and his family were only in Austin for about six weeks before he died. He was known by friends as a loving family man.
