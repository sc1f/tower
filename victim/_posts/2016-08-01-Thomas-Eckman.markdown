Thomas Frederick Eckman, a freshman studying anthropology, and his eight-month-pregnant girlfriend, Claire Wilson, were having coffee together on campus shortly before the shooting. As they began to head back to their car, Wilson was shot in the stomach. Eckman called out to Wilson and reached over to her, but then was shot outside Benedict Hall. Eckman died later in the hospital.

His fiancee’s unborn child died during an emergency surgery performed on Wilson.

He was survived by his mother, Mary Louise Eckman, his father, Frederick Eckman, and a half-brother, Michael R. Campbell.

In his memory, the Thomas F. Eckman Special Collections Division of Bowling Green State University’s Library was established. Eckman was from Spain but buried in Ottawa, Ohio.
