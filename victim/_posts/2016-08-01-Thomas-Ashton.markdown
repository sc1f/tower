Thomas Ashton was a recent graduate of the University of California visiting Austin for Peace Corps training.  

Ashton was on his way to meet with fellow trainees at the Student Union when he heard sudden noises and saw bodies falling to the ground. Exiting the UT Computation Center, Ashton looked toward the west side of the tower and was shot in the chest. Ashton died in Brackenridge Hospital soon after. 

Ashton is buried at Hillside Memorial Park in Redlands, California.
