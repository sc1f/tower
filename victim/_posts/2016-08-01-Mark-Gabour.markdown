Mark Gabour was visiting the University of Texas with his parents, M.J. and Mary, and brother, Mike, 18 from his hometown Texarkana, Texas. His father’s sister, Marguerite Lamport, lived in Austin with her husband, William, and was excited to show them around the city — the first stop was the landmark Tower at UT.

The family had planned to continue to San Antonio and Houston after their stop in Austin. Mark and his aunt, Marguerite Lamport, died. His brother, Mike, and mother, Mary Francis, lived but retained permanent injuries.

Gabour would have begun his junior year of high school three weeks later.
