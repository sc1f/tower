Billy Speed was an officer with the Austin Police Department from San Antonio, Texas. He was commissioned into the force on July 2, 1965. 
Speed was on his lunch break when he heard gunshots near the University and responded to a call of assistance from APD as he headed
toward campus.

When Speed and his partner, Jerry Culp, arrived at UT they took shelter under a statue in the South Mall. Whitman was able to shoot Speed through the rails surrounding the statue. The bullet hit Speed in the shoulder and traveled to his chest, killing him instantly. 

Speed is survived by his wife, Jean Speed, and daughter, Rebecca Lynn. He is buried at Fort Sam Houston Cemetery in San Antonio, Texas.
