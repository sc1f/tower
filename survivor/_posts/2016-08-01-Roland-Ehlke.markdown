In the summer of 1966, Roland Ehlke was in Austin preparing to leave for Iran with the Peace Corps. On August 1, he was headed to lunch with Tom Herman and David Mattson to meet the other volunteers.

When the shooting began, they didn’t realize it was gunfire — Ehlke said they assumed it was fireworks or construction. 

“When I was shot, I had no idea,” Ehlke said. “There was street work going on, and I thought something maybe had gone awry there. We didn’t know what was happening.”

Yells erupted just as Ehlke realized he’d been shot in the arm. The same bullet also struck his friend. Around them, Ehlke noticed people beginning to fall on the sidewalk. 

“After a while, it became clear it wasn’t an accident, but there was still confusion,” Ehlke said. 

They were trying to seek shelter in a jewelry store when Ehlke said a bullet hit Mattson’s wrist. While trying to help him, Ehlke was shot once again. Even after making it into the safety of the store, a bullet came through the glass and shot the owner. 

“We thought, maybe they’re coming in here for jewelry,” Ehlke said. “We heard noises behind, too —  people who were shooting up at the Tower. We realized at this point there was a shooting, but it seemed like maybe there was a gunfight.” 

Eventually, the three young men escaped by climbing out the back and over the fence to the alley, where an ambulance was already waiting. Ehlke said that even their ambulance driver was hit trying to get around to the front of the building.

Ehlke said they didn’t know a man had been shooting from the Tower until they arrived at the hospital. Although his week-long hospitalization caused him to miss out on his trip to Iran, he later recovered, and travelled to Afghanistan with the Peace Corps instead, still sporting bandages on his arm.

Ehlke later became a pastor, and today, he teaches classes on religion, English and literature at Concordia University. He said certain things from that hot summer day in 1966 are still so vivid in his memory that it hardly feels like 50 years have passed. 

“My life has been very blessed with children and grandchildren,” Ehlke said. “But I still think back on one of our friends, Tom [Ashton], who was shot and killed that day. It made me realize that life is brief, and you never know when it will end. Every day is a gift.”
