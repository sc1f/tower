Adrian Littlefield was 19 when the shooting occurred. His wife at the time, Brenda Gail Littlefield, worked in the University Tower at one of the state offices. They were visiting campus that day to pick up Brenda’s paycheck.
 
“I had just come out the door of the Tower building [on the south side],” Littlefield said. “My father was parked down by the fountains. He had come with me … We lived about 200 miles away in Conroe.” 
 
The shots began as the couple walked onto the South Mall to meet Adrian’s father. 

Brenda was hit first; the impact threw her several feet away. When Adrian went to check on her, a bullet hit him in his waistline.

Adrian’s father ran to his side and ordered medics to run him out on a stretcher. As they ran away, bullets rained down on the grass near them as Whitman fired off shots towards them.

They both survived their injuries, but Adrian was paralyzed for 20 months afterward.
 
“I still have a lot of pain from the injury,” Littlefield said. “I’ve had thirteen major surgeries [since the shooting and] still go to the doctor once a month to get around.”
 
Littlefield said physicians told him last year he would need surgery on his back, near the entry point of the bullet. He would require one procedure each year for the next four years. However, Littlefield said he has decided to opt out for the time being because of his age. 

Littlefield said the experience left a lasting impression on him. 

“I have an absolute unforgiving attitude toward people who … don’t care about other lives,” Littlefield said. 

Doctors told Littlefield right after the shooting that he would not be able walk or have children because of his injuries. Today, he can walk without much difficulty and he has two sons.
